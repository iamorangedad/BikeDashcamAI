```

#### Intelligent Editing
```swift
// Confidence-based segment selection
private func shouldIncludeFrame(_ analysisResult: VideoAnalysisResult) -> Bool
```

## Installation and Setup

### System Requirements
- iOS 17.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- Device supporting AVFoundation

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BikeDashcamAI.git
cd BikeDashcamAI
```

2. Open the Xcode project
```bash
open BikeDashcamAI.xcodeproj
```

3. Configure developer account
   - Select your developer account in Xcode
   - Update Bundle Identifier

4. Run the project
   - Select target device
   - Click the run button

### Permission Configuration

The app requires the following permissions:
- **Camera Permission**: For video recording
- **Microphone Permission**: For audio recording

Permissions are configured in Info.plist.

## Usage Guide

### Basic Operations

1. **Start Recording**
   - Tap the red record button to start filming
   - The app will automatically begin AI analysis

2. **Real-time Editing**
   - AI automatically identifies exciting moments during recording
   - Status bar displays current segment count

3. **Complete Recording**
   - Tap the record button again to stop filming
   - AI automatically processes and generates the final video

4. **View Results**
   - Tap the play button to view the edited video
   - Video is saved locally on the device

### Interface Description

- **Top Status Bar**: Shows recording status, AI processing progress, segment count
- **Record Button**: Start/stop recording
- **Settings Button**: App settings (to be implemented)
- **Play Button**: View final video

## Technical Highlights

### Real-time Processing
- Multi-threaded processing to avoid UI lag
- Intelligent cache management for optimized memory usage
- Asynchronous AI analysis for improved responsiveness

### Smart Algorithms
- Multi-dimensional analysis: motion, objects, scenes, actions
- Adaptive thresholds: dynamically adjust based on content
- Confidence weighting: make decisions based on multiple factors

### Performance Optimization
- Frame sampling: only analyze key frames for better performance
- Memory management: timely release of unnecessary frames
- Background processing: AI analysis runs on background threads

## Key Features

### Real-time AI Analysis
The app performs continuous analysis of video frames using multiple AI algorithms:

- **Motion Detection**: Uses frame difference analysis to detect significant movement
- **Scene Analysis**: Evaluates brightness, contrast, and visual appeal
- **Object Recognition**: Identifies interesting objects in the scene
- **Action Recognition**: Detects specific actions or events

### Intelligent Video Editing
- Automatically selects the most interesting segments based on AI analysis
- Maintains smooth transitions between segments
- Optimizes video length while preserving quality

### User Experience
- Clean, intuitive interface designed for one-handed operation
- Real-time feedback on recording and processing status
- Immediate access to edited videos
